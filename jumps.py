#Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers. Each array element represents the maximum length of the jumps that can be made forward from that element. This means if arr[i] = x, then we can jump any distance y such that y â‰¤ x. Find the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array starting from the first element. If an element is 0, then you cannot move through that element.
#Note:  Return -1 if you can't reach the end of the array.
#Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9]
#Output: 3 
#Explanation: First jump from 1st element to 2nd element with value 3. From here we jump to 5th element with value 9, and from here we will jump to the last.
